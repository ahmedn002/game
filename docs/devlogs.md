Implemented core player movement and modular skills. The skill system should allow skills to be easily used by either the player or the enemy.
I also implemented a skill queue system that allows the player to queue skills if they execute a skill while another skill is being executed.
Some skills have the ability to interrupt other skills such as dashing.
